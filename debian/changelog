gimp-plugin-registry (0.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Checking if we need to update debian/copyright or debian/control in the
      clean target now as a check by the build target does not work when using
      svn-buildpackage. Also monitor debian/{copyright,control}.in for
      changes.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Adding Vcs-* fields here instead of debian/control so we don't lose them
      again. Thanks to Thijs Kinkhorst for the hint.
    - Adding fftw3-dev to Build-Depends, needed by the new focus-blur version.
  * layer-effects:
    - Updating version number to 2.4 to follow upstream - no changes in the
      plugin, though.
  * focus-blur:
    - New upstream version

gimp-plugin-registry (0.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release of the lqr plugin which disables debug code the
    author accidentally left enabled in the last release. The debug code
    introduced a bug ironically.

gimp-plugin-registry (0.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use dh_install to copy documentation files as some of them are
    symlinks - dh_install doesn't dereference symlinks. Thanks to
    Christian Ohm for the report. (Closes: #447017)
  * debian/control:
    - Adding Vcs-{Browser,Svn} fields.
    - Removing autotools and automake Build-Dep, we're building refocus
      without autotools.
  * New upstream version of lqr.

gimp-plugin-registry (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adding extra checks to ensure that the debian/{copyright,control} were
    updated after modifying the description/version/copyright files in the
    plugin directories.
  * Modifying the update-description target to include version informations
    which are provided in the plugin directories now. Thanks to Nelson A. de
    Oliveira for the suggestion (Closes: #444591).
  * Enhancing common-autotools.mk to be able to build the Refocus plugin
    which needs some extra love due to a bit buggy build system.
  * New plugins:
    - Refocus (transition from gimp-refocus), also including a bugfix which
      was reported against the former package. The plugin needs some extra
      build-dependencies which were added.
    - Smart-Sharpen-Redux
    - Exposure Blend, thanks to Jurij Smakov  for the suggestion
      (Closes: #446507)

    - New plugin. Thanks to Ari Pollak for the hint.
