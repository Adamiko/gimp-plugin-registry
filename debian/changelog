gimp-plugin-registry (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adding extra checks to ensure that the debian/{copyright,control} were
    updated after modifying the description/version/copyright files in the
    plugin directories.
  * Modifying the update-description target to include version informations
    which are provided in the plugin directories now. Thanks to Nelson A. de
    Oliveira for the suggestion (Closes: #444591).
  * Enhancing common-autotools.mk to be able to build the Refocus plugin
    which needs some extra love due to a bit buggy build system.
  * New plugins:
    - Refocus (transition from gimp-refocus), also including a bugfix which
      was reported against the former package. The plugin needs some extra
      build-dependencies which were added.
    - Smart-Sharpen-Redux
    - Exposure Blend, thanks to Jurij Smakov  for the suggestion
      (Closes: #446507)
