Description: A repository of optional extensions for The GIMP
 The package contains the following plugins:
 .
   * Black and White Film Simulation (1.1):
     Converts the selected layer into Black and White using
     the channel mixer. Tries to produce results resembling
     tonal qualities of film.
   * David's Batch Processor (1.1.7):
     A simple batch processing plugin for The Gimp - it allows
     the user to automatically perform operations (such as resize)
     on a collection of image files.
   * Dustcleaner (0.1.5a):
     Plugin to detect and remove dust spots in digital images
   * Exposure Blend (1.3b):
     Prompt for 3 images in a bracketed exposure series (e.g. 0,-2,+2 EV)
     and blend these into a contrast enhanced image.
   * Fix-CA (3.0.1):
     Corrects chromatic aberration in photos
   * Focus-Blur (3.1.5):
     This plugin tries to simulate an out-of-focus blur
   * GREYCstoration (2.5.2.1):
     A tool to denoise, inpaint and resize images
   * Layer-Effects (2.4):
     This script implements the following effects:
     add border, bevel and emboss, color overlay, drop shadow,
     gradient overlay, inner glow, inner shadow, outer glow,
     pattern overlay, satin.
   * Liquid Rescale (0.3.0-2):
     Content-aware rescaling. Keeps the features of the image while
     rescaling along a single direction.
   * Planet Render (1-2):
     Creates a planet. Color, size and sun orientation
     can be set.
   * Refocus (0.9.1):
     The GIMP plugin to refocus images using FIR Wiener filtering.
     During image processing operations such as scanning and scaling, images
     tend to get blurry. The blurred impression of these images is due to the
     fact that image pixels are averaged with their neighbors. Blurred images
     don't have sharp boundaries and look as though they have been taken with
     an unfocussed camera.
   * Smart Sharpen (redux) (2.4):
     This script implements the redux version of smart sharpening. It utilizes
     the Unsharp Mask or Refocus plugin to sharpen the image.
   * Streak-Camera simulation (0.6):
     A streak camera images an object through a slit -
     thus getting a "one dimensional image". This image is
     propagated along the second dimension of the image plane
     at a constant speed. The result is a picture of the time
     dependency of the object.
