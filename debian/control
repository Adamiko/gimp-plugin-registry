Description: A repository of optional extensions for The GIMP
 The package contains the following plugins:
 .
   * Dustcleaner:
     Plugin to detect and remove dust spots in digital images
   * Fix-CA:
     Corrects chromatic aberration in photos
   * Focus-Blur:
     This plugin tries to simulate an out-of-focus blur
   * GREYCstoration:
     A tool to denoise, inpaint and resize images
   * Planet Render:
     Creates a planet. Color, size and sun orientation
     can be set.
   * Streak-Camera simulation:
     A streak camera images an object through a slit -
     thus getting a "one dimensional image". This image is
     propagated along the second dimension of the image plane
     at a constant speed. The result is a picture of the time
     dependency of the object.
