Description: A repository of optional extensions for The GIMP
 The package contains the following plugins:

     Converts the selected layer into Black and White using
     the channel mixer. Tries to produce results resembling
     tonal qualities of film.
   * DBP:
     David's Batch Processor is a simple batch processing plugin
     for The Gimp - it allows the user to automatically perform
     operations (such as resize) on a collection of image files.
   * Dustcleaner:
     Plugin to detect and remove dust spots in digital images
   * Fix-CA:
     Corrects chromatic aberration in photos

   * GREYCstoration:
     A tool to denoise, inpaint and resize images
   * layer-effects:

     add border, bevel and emboss, color overlay, drop shadow,
     gradient overlay, inner glow, inner shadow, outer glow,
     pattern overlay, satin.
   * Planet Render:
     Creates a planet. Color, size and sun orientation
     can be set.
   * Streak-Camera simulation:
     A streak camera images an object through a slit -
     thus getting a "one dimensional image". This image is
     propagated along the second dimension of the image plane
     at a constant speed. The result is a picture of the time
     dependency of the object.
