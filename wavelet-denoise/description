* Wavelet Denoise {version}:
  The wavelet denoise plugin is a tool to selectively reduce noise in
  individual channels of an image with optional RGB<->YCbCr conversion.
  It has a user interface to adjust the amount of denoising applied. The
  wavelet nature of the algorithm makes the processing quite fast.
