Description: Wavelet Decompose
 The wavelet decompose plugin decomposes a layer of an image into layers
 of wavelet scales. This means that you can edit the image on different
 detail scales (frequencies). The trivial recomposition of the image can
 be done by GIMP's layer modes so you can see the results of your
 modifications instantly. Among the applications are retouching, noise
 reduction, and enhancing global contrast.
