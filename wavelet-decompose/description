* Wavelet Decompose {version}:
  The wavelet decompose plugin decomposes a layer of an image into layers
  of wavelet scales. This means that you can edit the image on different
  detail scales (frequencies). The trivial recomposition of the image can
  be done by GIMP's layer modes so you can see the results of your
  modifications instantly. Among the applications are retouching, noise
  reduction, and enhancing global contrast.
