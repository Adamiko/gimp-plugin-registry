	<p>
	The Liquid Rescale plugin is an implementation of the content-aware resizing by
	seam carving algorithm by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir.
        <p>
        It aims at resizing pictures non uniformly while preserving the features of the picture,
	i.e. avoiding distortion of the important parts of the picture.
	It can also be used to remove portions of the picture in a consistent way.
        <p>
        It works both ways, but enarging is better obtained in successive steps.
	It can be manually instructed about what features of the image should be
	preserved and which should be discarded.
	<p>
	The plugin works on the active layer. See below for a full explanation of the plugin
	behavior in presence of selections, floating selections, quickmasks and masks.

	<p>
	<b>Select new width and height</b>
	<p>
	In this section it is possible to choose the final
	size. Rescaling is always performed on the width first, then on the height.
	The reverse order can be obtained by simply applying it twice, letting the width
	unchanged the first time, and the height the second.
	<p>
	<b>Feature preservation selection</b>
	<p>
	In this section it is possible to specify if there are regions of the image which
	should be preserved from modification, by checking the <b>Activate feature preservation</b>
	box, and by choosing a layer among the ones which belong to the current image (different
	from the active one, which is to be rescaled) by choosing it in the
	<b>Available layers</b> box. The intensity of the effect on each pixel is obtained as
	the average on the pixel's channels, including the alpha channel. Thus for an RGB layer
	with an alpha channel, the maximum value is achieved on white pixels, while black ones
	are worth one quarter of the white ones and transparent pixels are ignored. In general, it is
	advisable to work in monochrome, and modulate the intensity by just the transparency
	in case fine tuning is needed.
	The size and position of the selected layer can be arbitrary, the plugin will only use
	those portions which overlap with the active layer.
	The <b>Intensity</b> scale can be used as a global parameter to modulate the feature preservation.
	<p>
	<b>Feature discard selection</b>
	<p>
	This section is identical to the previous one, but the effect is reversed. This can be used
	to remove specific features from the image while shrinking it, or to let them expand
	while enlarging it. Best results are obtained if the removal is done in little steps.
	<p>
	<b>Select gradient function</b>
	<p>
	In this section it is possible to choose which function
	is to be used to calculate the energy map of the image. For each pixel in the image,
	the x,y components of the gradient are computed from the pixel's four nearest neighbors.
	The exact form of the energy map depends on the choice of the gradient function, and
	this in turn determines which elements of the image are more important, and should
	thus be preserved, and which are not, and can be removed (if shrinking) or inflated
	(if enlarging).
	<p>
	<b>Options</b>
	<p>
	<b>Update energy at every step.</b>
	Specifies if the algorithm will update the energy map of the image after each seam
	removal (image alteration can affect the energy map on which the carving is based).
	<p>
	<b>Rescale image canvas.</b>
	Specifies wether the image canvas should be rescaled to meet the new size of the active
	layer. If this option is checked, the active layer will be repositioned to be
	fully visible.
	<p>
	<font size="+1">
		<b>Behavior in presence of floating selections, selections, channels,
			quickmasks and masks</b>
	</font>
	<p>
	If the plugin is invoked on a floating selection, this is immedietely applied and 
	the plugin continues to work on the result (a layer or a channel)
	<p>
	In case there is an active selection, this is copied to a channel for backup and
        cleared. The channel is ignored.
	<p>
	If the plugin is invoked on a channel, this is un-selected and ignored, and
	the plugin continues to work on the active layer.
	The same applies to quickmasks, as they are special kinds of channels.
	<p>
	In the case in which the layer on which the plugin is invoked has a mask, or if it is
	directly invoked on the mask, the interface dialog will offer the choice between
	discarding the mask or applying it before the rescaling algorithm is applied.
