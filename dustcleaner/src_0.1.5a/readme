Installation
============

DustCleaner requires GTK+-2.10.x, OpenCV 1.0 and GIMP 2.2.x libraries.
But I didn't testify whether it can be compiled in other environment.
Simple install procedure:

  % tar -xf src_0.1.5a.tar 		    		# unpack the sources
  % cd src_0.1.5a                         # goto the toplevel directory  
  % make -f Makefile                      # build DustCleaner
  % cp dustcleaner ~/.gimp-2.2/plug-ins/  # install DustCleaner

About
======

I am Frank Tao, the only developer of this plugin. I am interested in 
image processing but not a proficient C programmer. It will be 
appreciated if you give me any suggestion/correction about the coding 
or design. Thanks. (^_')
